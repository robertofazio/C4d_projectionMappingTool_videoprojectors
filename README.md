C4d_projectionMappingTool_videoprojectors
=========================================

C4d_projectionMappingTool_videoprojectors is a basic c4d tool that allows you to find the relationships between c4d virtual camera 
and videoprojectors. 

This example is for the Christie videoprojector which has a sensor film gate of 0.95 inch ( 24,13 mm ). 
Basically you have to click on to SETUP CAMERA null object and then choose the distance from videoprojector to the building/screen.
Later select your Zoom optical value and you'll find the right focal lenght of the camera and the right screen size with a calculating error of 5%.

If you want to use different type of videoprojectors you have just to change the right filmgate ( take a look into manual )

This is first basic version, I will update soon with new features.
